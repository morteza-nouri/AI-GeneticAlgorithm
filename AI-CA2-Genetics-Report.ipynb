      "Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.\n",

The further increase of the population size increases the accuracy of solution but larger populations  does not improve the solution accuracy and only increase the needed computational resources because large diversity of chromosomes should be explored.\n",
    "\n",

    "_mutation:_ increases the diversity of the population and provides a mechanism for escaping from a local optimum.(divergence operator)<br>\n",

    "If the mutation is not used, the population get stuck in local optimum So we can't explore more space.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4- The most significant part of GA is crossover. It increases the accuracy and converges the population to the goal state. Mutation happens in small probability but prevents from local optimum thus more states are explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- In fact one of the indicators that the result is converging to a solution is repetition of population. But by increasing crossover probability and mutation probability we can explore more combinations of population.\n",
    "Also we can record each tested individual and compare the regenerated individuals with the recorded ones to avoid any repetition but this method consumes many resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- crossover, because converges the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "7- In crossover and mutation, I compare new children with their parents and if a child has fitness lower than its parent I avoid adding this child to the population, So the population fitness rate increases and always next generation have fitness greater or equal than it previous generation. Also if we know some characters of the key, the state space decreases."
