# AI-GeneticAlgorithm
Artificial Intelligence Course - Computer Assignment 2 - Genetic Algorithm - University of Tehran - Spring 1401

## Goals:
- How to formulate a problem to be solved using genetic algorithm
- Power of genetic algorithm to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems
- How to choose appropriate heuristic function to select fittest individuals

## Description:
> In this project, we are given an encoded text which we want to find a key using genetic algorithm inorder to decode the text file.
We use [vigenere ciphering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) method to encryption and decryption.
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.
